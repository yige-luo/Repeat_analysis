Module repeatmodeler-2.0-lssc0-linux loaded. RepeatModeler is a de-novo repeat family identification and modeling package. At the heart of RepeatModeler are two de-novo repeat finding programs ( RECON and RepeatScout ) which employ complementary computational methods for identifying repeat element boundaries and family relationships from sequence data. RepeatModeler assists in automating the runs of RECON and RepeatScout given a genomic database and uses the output to build, refine and classify consensus models of putative interspersed repeats.

Storage Throughput = poor ( 6.02 MB/s )
  - NOTE: Poor storage througput will have a large impact on RepeatModeler
          performance.  The low throughput observed above may be due to
          transient usage patterns on the system and may not reflect the
          actual system performance. Whenever possible run RepeatModeler
          in a directory stored on a fast local disk and not over a
          network filesytem.

Ready to start the sampling process.
INFO: The runtime of RepeatModeler heavily depends on the quality of the assembly
      and the repetitive content of the sequences.  It is not imperative
      that RepeatModeler completes all rounds in order to obtain useful
      results.  At the completion of each round, the files ( consensi.fa, and
      families.stk ) found in:
      /share/kopplab/yige/C202SC19030542/2023-06-27/References/RepeatModeler/Dpro/RM_7844.WedJun281500362023/ 
      will contain all results produced thus far. These files may be 
      manually copied and run through RepeatClassifier should the program
      be terminated early.

There is a problem in the configuration of your shell.
Check the MAFFT_BINARIES environmental variable by
$ echo $MAFFT_BINARIES

This variable must be *unset*, unless you have installed MAFFT
with a special configuration.  To unset this variable, type
$ unset MAFFT_BINARIES
or
% unsetenv MAFFT_BINARIES
Then retry
$ mafft input > output

To keep this change permanently, edit setting files
(.bash_profile, .profile, .cshrc, etc) in your home directory
to delete the MAFFT_BINARIES line.
On MacOSX, also edit or remove the .MacOSX/environment.plist file
and then re-login (MacOSX 10.6) or reboot (MacOSX 10.7).

Please send a problem report to katoh@ifrec.osaka-u.ac.jp,
